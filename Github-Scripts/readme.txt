How to use the Bash Shell scripts to automate the process of:-

1) Clone from Github

and

2) Push to Github


There are 2 scripts in this folder ie.

1) 1-CloneFromGitHub-RepoName.sh

2) 2-Push2GitHub-RepoName.sh


Before you can use these scripts you need to do the following:-

1) Create a folder in your C: drive and call it C:\GitHub
   Note: If you already done this then ignore this step

2) Create a Repo in Github
   Note: If you already done this then ignore this step
